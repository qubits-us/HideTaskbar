# HideTaskbar
Small app to hide or show windows taskbar.<br>

Needed this in a scenerio.<br>
small and to the point.<br>

using it on win 10-11<br>

default is to hide, use /show to show the taskbar.
<br>

can be used with hidecursor to also hide arrow.<br>
see release folder has hidden.cur and display.bat which can be run at system startup.<br>
taskbar autohide doesnt always do the trick, if you want your screens black..<br>


peace
